# Routines

Routines provides JavaScript primitives that make it possible to *coordinate asynchronous code* without callbacks or chained functions. 

As a result, stack traces are crystal clear so debugging is easy.

Routines is inspired by Goroutines and Channels, found in the Go language.

## Getting Started

### Building
1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:routines/routines.git`
2. Install dev dependencies: `sh init.sh`
3. Build: `grunt build`

Both ES5 and ES6 builds are produced (in the /dist-es5 and /dist-es6 directories respectively) and for each the build output includes modules in the AMD, CommonJS, and module pattern formats.


### Browser

#### Browsers that support ES6 Generators
Routines relies on Generators, introduced in ES6. Currently, Firefox supports ES6 Generators. Chrome also supports generators, but you must first enable it in chrome:flags / #enable-javascript-harmony.

To use Routines, simply build it by running `grunt build`, and picking one of the routines.js files in /dist-es6.
The build produces three outputs: AMD, CommonJS, and module pattern format.

#### All other browsers
The build produces not only ES6 code in /dist-es6, but also ES5-compatible code in /dist-es5. The ES5 code is produced by transpiling the ES6 source code using Facebook's Regenerator, which converts generator syntax into a state machine. The /dist-es5 folder also includes generator-runtime.js, which you must include in your ES5 project.

To run your project that uses Routines in non-ES6 browsers, you need to include the following scripts:
a) routines.js from /dist-es5
b) generator-runtime.js from /dist-es5
c) your script, transpiled using Facebook Regenerator

You can get Facebook Regenerator by running `npm install -g regenerator`. It is hosted at https://github.com/facebook/regenerator


### Node
Routines is published as an NPM package for Node 0.11.10+ when running with the --harmony flag.

`npm install routines`


## Examples
You can find examples in /demos/web/es6, and the transipiled versions in /demos/web/es5.


## Generators

Routines relies on JavaScript Generators, introduced in ES6. For your code to work in current JavaScript environments you need to use a transpiler that converts ES6 Generator syntax to ES5 semantics. Two popular ways are Google Traceur (which supports not only Generators, but also many other ES6 features like lambda syntax, destructuring, etc.) and Facebook Regenerator (which focuses on Generator support only).

We use Facebook Regenerator.
